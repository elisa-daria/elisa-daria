# 🧜‍♀️ Hey there, I’m Elisa Daria (she/they)

🌈 Queer mermaid & full-stack developer who loves clean design, inclusive tech, and small details that make the web feel human.  
Currently working as a **Frontend Developer at [Titanka!](https://www.titanka.com)**.

I’m not super active here, but you can peek at a few projects I’ve built —  
the main one being **[MoodWatch](https://mood-watch.vercel.app/)** 🎬  
An app that suggests movies & series based on your vibe of the moment.  
Backend lives [here](https://github.com/elisa-daria/be-mood_watch).  
There’s also a **queer media database** feature already in progress —  
partially built, and (probably) gonna get more love when I find the time 🕐 —  
aimed at making titles searchable by **queer tropes and representation**.

Mostly playing with **HTML · CSS · SASS · JS · React · Java**,  
and always learning something new along the way.
