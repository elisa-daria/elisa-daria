# 🧜‍♀️ Hey there, I’m Elisa Daria (she/they)

🌈 Queer mermaid & web developer jr who loves clean design, inclusive tech, and small details that make the web feel human.  
Currently working as a <strong>Frontend Developer at

I’m not super active here, but you can peek at a few projects I’ve built —  
the main one being

MoodWatch</a> 🎬  
Backend lives <a href="https://github.com/elisa-daria/be-mood_watch" target="_blank" style="color:#03ca92; text-decoration: none;">
here</a>.  
There’s also a <strong>queer media database</strong> feature already in progress —  
partially built, and (probably) gonna get more love when I find the time 🕐 —  
aimed at making titles searchable by **queer tropes and representation**.

Mostly playing with **HTML · CSS · SASS · JS · React · Java**,  
and always learning something new along the way.
